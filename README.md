# MXBean-Example

### Description
This is an example application that exposes an simple MXBean. Nothing fancy.

### Walkthrough

- The Java EE application server starts and starts the Singleton EJB.

- The singletons init function creates an MXBean and registers it with the JVM's MBean server as Application:name=QueueChecker.


### Tests

To test the MXBean the JConsole is an excellent tool.

Fire it up and connect to the local process.

Navigate to MBeans.

  Our EJB's startup has not finished just yet. Our MXBean has not been registered with the MBEan Server.

Our MXbean has now been registered and we can browse the attributes and execute operations.
